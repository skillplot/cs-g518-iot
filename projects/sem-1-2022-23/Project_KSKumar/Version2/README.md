Road damage detection without comparision(i.e old image is not needed). 
Download the entire version2 onto your Raspberry pi.
Only the potholeDetectPiCamSchedule needs to be executed on the raspberry pi. Other files are the alternate versions.
potholeDetectionLocalImages uses local images instead of pi camera. So you can test damaged roads with local images(eg:downloaded from internet).
