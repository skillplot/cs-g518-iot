Road damage detection without comparision(i.e old image is not needed). </br>
Download the entire version2 onto your Raspberry pi. </br>
Only the <b>potholeDetectPiCamSchedule</b> needs to be executed on the raspberry pi. Other files are the alternate versions. </br>
potholeDetectionLocalImages uses local images instead of pi camera. So you can test damaged roads with local images(eg:downloaded from internet).</br>
